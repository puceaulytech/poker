# Poker

## Features

The app is able to detect every single poker hand and display them decently
good (except the royal straight flush).
To decide a winner, it not only covers which hand types are better but also
a lot of cases of equality.
The input is pretty permissive, it handles a lot of things the user could try to enter.

## Usage

Start the app:

```bash
./gradlew run --console=plain
```

Run the tests:

```bash
./gradlew test
```
